Yes, it's possible to create a bootable pendrive that contains your golden image and allows you to install it onto a physical server, similar to a traditional Linux installation process. This can be achieved by creating a custom Linux live USB with the image and a script to deploy it. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Prepare the Golden Image

1. **Create the golden image** (as previously described):
   ```sh
   sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/save/image.img bs=4M status=progress
   gzip /path/to/save/image.img
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Bootable Pendrive

1. **Download a Linux Live ISO**: Download a lightweight Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu Server or a minimal version of Ubuntu.

2. **Create a bootable USB**:
   - On Linux, use `dd`:
     ```sh
     sudo dd if=/path/to/linux.iso of=/dev/sdY bs=4M status=progress && sync
     ```
   - On Windows, use a tool like `Rufus`.

### Step 3: Add the Golden Image and Deployment Script to the Pendrive

1. **Mount the USB drive**:
   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/sdY1 /mnt
   ```

2. **Copy the compressed golden image** to the pendrive:
   ```sh
   sudo cp /path/to/save/image.img.gz /mnt/
   ```

3. **Create the deployment script** (`deploy_image.sh`):
   ```sh
   sudo nano /mnt/deploy_image.sh
   ```

   Paste the following script into the `deploy_image.sh` file:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Check if running as root
   if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "Please run as root"
     exit 1
   fi

   # Define variables
   IMAGE_PATH="/mnt/image.img.gz"  # Path to the image file on the pendrive
   TARGET_DISK="/dev/sda"         # Default target disk

   # Unmount any mounted partitions on the target disk
   umount ${TARGET_DISK}?* 2>/dev/null

   # Restore the image
   echo "Restoring image to $TARGET_DISK..."
   gunzip -c "$IMAGE_PATH" | dd of="$TARGET_DISK" bs=4M status=progress

   # Reinstall GRUB bootloader
   echo "Reinstalling GRUB bootloader..."
   mount "${TARGET_DISK}1" /mnt
   mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
   mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
   mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
   chroot /mnt /bin/bash -c "grub-install $TARGET_DISK && update-grub"

   # Unmount filesystems
   umount /mnt/sys
   umount /mnt/proc
   umount /mnt/dev
   umount /mnt

   echo "Deployment complete. Please reboot the server."

   exit 0
   ```

4. **Make the script executable**:
   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x /mnt/deploy_image.sh
   ```

5. **Unmount the USB drive**:
   ```sh
   sudo umount /mnt
   ```

### Step 4: Boot and Deploy

1. **Boot the target server** from the USB drive.
2. **Open a terminal** in the live environment.
3. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```sh
   sudo /path/to/deploy_image.sh
   ```

This setup creates a bootable USB drive with a custom script to deploy the golden image to a physical server, making the process similar to a traditional Linux installation.

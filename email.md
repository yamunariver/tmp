We have a Kaspersky server running on Windows Server 2016 and a client on Linux Mint 21.3 LTS. These devices are not connected to the internet. We successfully installed Kaspersky Endpoint Security and the agent on the client system, and the device was added to the Kaspersky server. However, the server shows that real-time protection is not running, and the application databases are not loaded. On the client system, the application databases are not updated, scanning is not working, and the license status appears to be corrupted.
